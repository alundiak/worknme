# TODO

* Analyze Pros and Cons of migration, and if all good, do it :)

# Pros

* Markdown syntax, easy and plain text, no wordpress editor pain.

# Cons

* Looks like not possible to embed links from guthub, gistm codepen, jsfiddle, plunkr, etc


# Examples / Resources

* https://nodejs.org/api/all.html#documentation_about_this_documentation
> Every .html document has a corresponding .json document presenting the same information in a structured manner. This feature is experimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that wish to do programmatic things with the documentation.
Every .html and .json file is generated based on the corresponding .md file in the doc/api/ folder in Node.js's source tree. The documentation is generated using the tools/doc/generate.js program. The HTML template is located at doc/template.html.
